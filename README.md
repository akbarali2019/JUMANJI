# Main Idea of the Project
The main idea is unreality that is based on reality. What does it mean? In our game, unreality would be a hero, enemies, maze way and some challenges. Interestingly, why it is based on reality? Because, we can see a hero as a person, then enemies, maze way and challenges could be seen real difficulties and problems in our real life. More specifically, there would be some enemies and a hero in our labyrinth game. A hero should find a true way in order to reach to the next level. In this way, a hero may face some challenges and enemies along his ways. There may be 4 or 5 levels. The difficulty of the levels is being increased step by step. So, players can learn somehow, how to overcome real life difficulties with the help of our game.
